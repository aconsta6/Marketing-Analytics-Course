## Course description:  
In today’s world, businesses are run on data-driven decision-making. Businesses know that developing profitable business strategies, product innovations, and communication campaigns depends on the data a business collects. To unlock the insights contained in the data, businesses need employees who are able to analyze, understand and explain data. The goal of this course is to provide you with the skills to analyze data and articulate the results to both technical and non-technical marketing audiences. Special emphasis will be put on the implications of data analysis for marketing plans and strategies.

Traditional marketing analytics courses focus purely on the measures and metrics frequently used in the industry. However, this approach fails to acknowledge that marketing analytics is inherently tied to consumer behavior. If it weren’t for consumers, what would we be measuring? This course will focus its attention on the way marketing analytics are created and used to measure emerging consumer behaviors at the forefront of marketing. This will prepare you for employers working to capture newer metrics that have yet to make it into the textbooks of marketing.
