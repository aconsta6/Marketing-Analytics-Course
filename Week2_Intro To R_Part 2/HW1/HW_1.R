# BACKGROUND: Imagine you're consulting for a pasta brand that is sold in Walmart stores across the country. 
# Walmart has decided that based on your client's sales, they might cut their distribution to only Walmart 
# stores in the northeast. The objective of this homework is to use the data to help show why it would be beneficial 
# to Walmart to keep you in stores nation-wide.

# QUESTION 1: Without looking at the data, think about what kind of argument you would make to Walmart? For this questions, I'm just looking for the conceptual argument you would want to make.

# QUESTION 2: Looking at the dataset, please identify which variables and analyses would help support the argument you want to make in question 1. Please be as specific as possible. For example "I need variable A (age) and variable B (money spent in past month) to run a correlation. This will help support that older people spend more money."

# QUESTION 3: Is there any data missing that would help you support the argument outlined in question 1? What additional data would you need. Please identify the variable and what the data should look like (e.g., text, numeric, dollar, etc.)

# QUESTION 4: Run the analyses outlined in question 2. Please be sure you should all your code for this analysis.

# QUESTION 5: Given the analyses you ran in question 4, does everything still support your argument? After your analysis, please write what you say / show / present to Walmart.
